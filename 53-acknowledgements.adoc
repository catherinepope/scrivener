First, thank you to Literature and Latte for developing Scrivener. Although I often curse you during the compilation and export stage, you’ve made an enormous difference to my writing productivity.

I’ve shared Scrivener with hundreds of PhD researchers over the last few years. They’ve asked insightful questions and helped me see new possibilities. And seeing them understand the potential of Scrivener is wonderfully motivating.

While writing this book, I completed a qualification in technical writing. Feedback from Ellis Pratt was helpful in improving the clarity of my explanations.

Philippa St George has provided encouragement and friendship throughout this project. She kindly provided detailed feedback on the first edition, resulting in a much-improved book.

My partner, Tanya Izzard, has also encouraged me with this book and with everything else. 

Finally, I want to thank _you_ for wanting to share your knowledge and insights with the world.
