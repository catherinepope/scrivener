== Getting Help and Support

One of Scrivener's strengths is that the developers put a lot of effort into providing support. An especially helpful feature is the Interactive Help menu. Click on *Help* in the menu bar, then type what you're looking for in the search bar.

If it's a Scrivener feature, you'll then see it highlighted on the menus so you know how to find it.

I use this feature all the time, so don't feel as though you have to remember all this stuff.


Under Help, you'll also see links to tutorials. And there’s an exhaustive Scrivener manual. It's around 750 pages long, so I really do mean _exhaustive_. 

For intractable problems, you can contact the Scrivener support team through the menu. They’re incredibly helpful and responsive. The User Forums are also great. Although I want to help you, the Scrivener community is likely to provide a swifter and more comprehensive response.
