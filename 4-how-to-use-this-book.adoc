If you're new to Scrivener, I'd suggest reading this ebook from beginning to end. Then you can identify the topics most relevant to you and and focus on those. If you’re already familiar with Scrivener, you can jump around using the table of contents to find what you need.

I won't tell you everything about a topic at first — it gradually builds over the ebook so you're not overwhelmed. We'll start with the basics, then get more sophisticated.

If you’re reading this on an e-ink Kindle or Kobo (those with the small monochrome screens), you’ll struggle to see some of the detail in the screenshots. You can enlarge any image by tapping on it and zooming, or you might find it easier to view them on your desktop computer using the Kindle for Mac software (available free from the Amazon website) or https://www.adobe.com/uk/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html[Adobe Digital Editions] (available free from the Adobe website).
