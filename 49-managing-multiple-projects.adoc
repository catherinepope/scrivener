== Managing Multiple Projects

Sometimes, you'll want to work on multiple projects in Scrivener. Perhaps you're writing your thesis and a journal article at the same time, or you want to create different versions of the same project. When I wrote my previous book, the structure became a complete nightmare. It was easiest for me to create a whole new Scrivener project and transplant individual documents from the old version.

If you have multiple projects open, they appear in tabs below the toolbar. To display them in separate windows, click and drag one of the tabs outside of Scrivener.

With two projects alongside each other, youâ€™re able to move documents between them by clicking and dragging.

=== Copying Project Settings

You can copy Section Types - explain how.

Click and drag any front matter to the new project (make sure this doesn't remove it from the original project.)

You can't easily copy labels, statuses, auto-complete lists, or custom metadata. If you're likely to reuse these elements across multiple projects, I'd recommend creating an empty Scrivener project that you use as a template.

Once you've configured this project, click *File > Save as Template*.

Populate this template with all the settings you need, then you can click *File > Save As* to create another project with those settings.

Give it a name and click OK.

When you next create a new project in Scrivener, you'll have the option of using this template.

=== Finding Scrivener Projects

I'm a menace for not consistently saving my projects in the same place, or using any kind of logic. Fortunately, there's an easy way to find them. 

In Scrivener, click *File > Find All Projects in Spotlight*. You'll then see a list of all your Scrivener projects, including many that you had abandoned and completely forgotten about. That's exactly what happens to your brain when you're doing a PhD.
