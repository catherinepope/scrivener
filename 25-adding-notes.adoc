=== Adding Notes

Notes are where you can jot down ideas as you write without affecting your document. They’re similar to sticky notes, except they don’t get stuck to your socks and end up on the other side of the house. They live under the first tab in the Inspector.

You can resize the Notes pane by clicking and dragging the top or the side. Or you can hide this pane altogether by clicking the down arrow in the top left-hand corner of the Notes pane.

Unlike synopses, you can write as much as you like in a Note and also format the text using the formatting toolbar. You can even drag in an image from your computer to liven it up.

I use Notes as a place to park random bits of text when I’m not entirely sure what to do with them. It’s also a good place to keep quotes and outlines.
